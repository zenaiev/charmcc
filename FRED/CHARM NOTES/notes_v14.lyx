The charged current DIS charm production process involves some interesting
 issues that we will explore here in detail.
 Because it is a flavor-changing process, two quark masses are involved
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{m_{s},m_{c}\}$
\end_inset

; thus, we can examine the mass singularities of the 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-channel and 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

-channel separately.
 This separation is particularly useful to understand how the individual
 mass singularities are addressed, and how FFNS and VFNS organize the contributi
ons to the total structure function.

[FRED: REVISED AFTER DISCUSSION]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be specific, we will consider charged-current DIS production of a charm
 quark.
 We first compute this in a 3-flavor (FFNS) scheme where {u,d,s} are light
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

active
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 partons in the proton, and charm is considered an external 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

heavy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 particle.
 This can be implemented in the ACOT scheme for example by using a CWZ renormali
zation where the light 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

active
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 partons are renormalized with normal 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{MS}$
\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

heavy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quarks use a zero-momentum subtraction.

In this scheme, the LO process is 
\begin_inset Formula $sW^{+}\to c$

 as illustrated in Fig.***.
 
\end_layout

At NLO, we then include 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

[t-channel]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The t-channel process has an intermediate 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-quark exchanged, and if we use the strange quark mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{s}$
\end_inset

 to regulate the singularities, this will yield a contribution proportional
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu/m_{s})$
\end_inset

.
 This mass singularity arises from the region of phase space where the exchanged
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

-quark becomes collinear and close to the mass-shell; that is, when the
 phase space of the 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 process begins to overlap with that of the 
\begin_inset Formula $sW^{+}\to c$
\end_inset

 process.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

double counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is resolved by a subtraction (SUB) counter-term (which is formally part
 of the NLO contribution) given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}\otimes{\cal P}{}_{g\to s}\otimes\sigma_{sW^{+}\to c}$
\end_inset

, and this ensures that the NLO calculation is well-defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mu/m_{s})\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal P}{}_{g\to s}$
\end_inset

 is the perturbative splitting of the gluon into an 
\begin_inset Formula $s\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 pair; the leading term is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha_{S}}{2\pi}P_{g\to q}^{(1)}\ln(\mu^{2}/m_{c}^{2})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{g\to q}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{S}$
\end_inset

 DGLAP splitting kernel for 
\begin_inset Formula $g\to q$
\end_inset

.

[u-channel]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We next examine the u-channel contribution to the 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 process.
 This has an intermediate 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

-quark exchanged, and is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu/m_{c})$
\end_inset

.
 In the FFNS where the charm is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

heavy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 non-parton, there is no counter-term for this graph, and the resulting
 observables will retain the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu/m_{c})$
\end_inset

 dependence.
 In principle, this means when we go to large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

-scales, these terms will begin to degrade the convergence of our perturbation
 series.
 In practice, while this degradation only grows logarithmically, at large
 scales (such as at the LHC) we do find it convenient to treat the charm
 on an equal-footing as the {u,d,s} partons.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case there is a u-channel counter-term given by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}\otimes{\cal P}{}_{g\to\bar{c}}\otimes\sigma_{\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}}$
\end_inset

 which will cancel the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu/m_{c})$
\end_inset

 dependence and ensures that the NLO calculation is well-defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mu/m_{c})\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is less obvious is that we also must include the LO process 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 There are two ways we can understand why this is necessary.

[EXPLANATION #1: LO-SUB MATCHING AT THRESHOLD]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that in the t-channel case, the subtraction term removed the double
 counting between the LO 
\begin_inset Formula $sW^{+}\to c$
\end_inset

 and NLO 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 processes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The u-channel case is analogous in that this subtraction term removes the
 double counting between the LO 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 and NLO 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 processes; both contributions are required to ensure the resulting cross
 section is insensitive to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

-scale.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is apparent in Fig.*** where we plot the individual terms versus the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 scale.
 In the region of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\sim m_{c}$
\end_inset

, the charm PDF 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 (and hence, the LO contribution) rises very quickly as it is driven by
 the very large gluon, and coupled with a large 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{S}(\mu)$
\end_inset

.
 The SUB subtraction also rises quickly as this is driven by the logarithmic
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu^{2}/m_{c}^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $(LO-SUB)$
\end_inset

 is the physical contribution to the total 
\begin_inset Formula $(TOT=LO+NLO-SUB)$
\end_inset

, and it is this combination which is smooth across the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the charm PDF.
 We now see that if we neglect the LO (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

) we loose the cancellation between LO and SUB in the region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\sim m_{c}$
\end_inset

, and our structure function (or cross section) would have an anomalous
 shift at the arbitrarily location where we turn on the charm PDF.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we vary the unphysical renormalization scale 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, we are simply shifting contribution between the various terms.
 While the individual 
\begin_inset Formula $\{LO,NLO,SUB\}$
\end_inset

 terms exhibit a large 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

-dependence, the combination 
\begin_inset Formula $(TOT)$
\end_inset

 which represents the physical observable is relatively insensitive to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 (up to higher orders).

[EXPLANATION #2: THERE REALLY IS CHARM IN THE FINAL STATE]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second way to understand why the LO process 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 is required is to consider the regions of phase space covered by each of
 the sub-processes.
 The singularity of the u-channel NLO 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 processes arises the phase space region when the intermediate 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$
\end_inset

 quark becomes collinear and close to the mass-shell.
 This is precisely the phase space region of the LO process 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 where the partonic 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$
\end_inset

-quark is collinear to the hadron.
 The SUB term then removes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

double counting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 between the LO and NLO contributions; hence, all three contributions 
\begin_inset Formula $\{LO,NLO,SUB\}$
\end_inset

 are necessary to cover the full phase space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
Note the combination of the LO and SUB terms ensure a minimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 are canceled at high

 is ill-defined; instead, what is measured experimentally is a differential
 cross section for producing a charm quark in the final state in a fiducial
 region; as we go to higher orders, we must be careful how we define this
 quantity so that it is singularity-free and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

-independent.
 This is an issue for both the FFNS and VFNS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can compute in the FFNS, but in the large energy limit, we encounter
 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu^{2}/m_{c}^{2})$
\end_inset

 divergences and this, in part, gives rise to the observed differences at
 large 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 scales.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VFNS includes the charm quark as an active parton for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 scales above a threshold value, and this is calculation is free of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\mu^{2}/m_{c}^{2})$
\end_inset

 divergences.
 In the region 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu\sim m_{c}$
\end_inset

, there is a cancellation between the LO and SUB contributions.
 As this can be delicate to implement numerically, we have the option of
 displacing the threshold to a larger 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 scale where the cancellation is more stable as was demonstrated in Ref.***.

[FRED: THIS INTRO IS STILL ROUGH] Suppose we attempt to compute the

\begin_inset Formula $F_{2}^{charm}$
\end_inset

 for Charged Current (CC) charm production at NLO in the VFNS.
 The obvious LO diagram is 
\begin_inset Formula $(sW^{+}\to c).$
\end_inset

 What is not so obvious is we also will need (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

).
 This is because the 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$
\end_inset

 comes from a gluon splitting to 
\begin_inset Formula $c\bar{c}$
\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 goes down the beam pipe along with the hadron remnants.
 All three

\begin_inset Formula $Q^{2}$

 scales; but this requires measuring charm quarks in an experimentally unaccessi
ble regionâ€”the hadron remnants.
 This is why a truly 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is ill-defined; it is experimentally unobservable.

\begin_layout Subsection
t-channel at NLO
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The t-channel contributions at NLO are straightforward.
 We start with a leading-order (LO) 
\begin_inset Formula $sW^{+}\to c$
\end_inset

 process.
 We then add the next-to-leading-order (NLO) 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 diagram; this exchanges an 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 quark in the t-channel, and thus will have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(m_{s}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

 divergence for large 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 This is resolved by the subtraction (SUB) term 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}\otimes{\cal P}_{g\to s}\otimes\sigma_{sW^{+}\to c}$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal P}_{g\to s}$
\end_inset

 represents a perturbative splitting of 
\begin_inset Formula $g\to s$
\end_inset

; the SUB term is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal P}_{g\to s}\sim\frac{\alpha_{S}}{2\pi}\:P_{g\to s}^{(1)}\:\ln(m_{s}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

, and will cancel the double counting between the LO and NLO graphs in the
 limit where the exchanged 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 quark becomes collinear.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here we use 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal P}_{g\to s}$
\end_inset

 to represent the perturbative splitting contribution which at NLO is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\alpha_{S}}{2\pi}\:P_{g\to s}^{(1)}\:\ln(m_{s}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{g\to s}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 is the usual DGLAP splitting kernel.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The logarithmic divergence (mass singularity) will cancel between the NLO
 and SUB terms as 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{2}\to\infty$
\end_inset

, resulting in a finite result for the NLO t-channel contribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
u-channel at NLO
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The u-channel at NLO is more subtle.
 We definitely need the NLO 
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

 diagram with a 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$
\end_inset

 quark exchanged in the u-channel, and thus will have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(m_{c}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

 divergence for large 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 This is resolved by the subtraction term 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}\otimes{\cal P}_{g\to\bar{c}}\otimes\sigma_{\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}}$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal P}_{g\to\bar{c}}$
\end_inset

 represents a perturbative splitting of 
\begin_inset Formula $g\to\bar{c}$
\end_inset

 and will cancel the double counting between the LO and NLO graphs in the
 limit where the exchanged 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}$
\end_inset

 quark becomes collinear.
 Here, the SUB term is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal P}_{g\to\bar{c}}\sim\frac{\alpha_{S}}{2\pi}\:P_{g\to\bar{c}}^{(1)}\:\ln(m_{c}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The logarithmic divergence will cancel between the NLO and SUB terms as
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{2}\to\infty$
\end_inset

, resulting in a finite result for the NLO u-channel contribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why do we need the LO (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

)?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is not so obvious is that we need the LO 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

-channel process 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that it is essential we include the subtraction SUB term 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}\otimes{\cal P}_{g\to\bar{c}}\otimes\sigma_{\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}}$
\end_inset

 so that we get a finite answer at large energies 
\begin_inset Formula $Q^{2}\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At energy scales 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\sim m_{c}$
\end_inset

, the LO and SUB terms remove the double counting between the LO and NLO
 processes.
 This is most apparent when you plot the individual terms versus the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 scale (or more properly, it is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 scale).
 [See Figure] In the region of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\sim m_{c}$
\end_inset

, the charm PDF 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 (and hence, the LO contribution) rises very quickly as it is driven by
 the very large gluon, and coupled with a large 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{S}(m_{c})$
\end_inset

.
 The SUB subtraction also rises quickly as this is driven by the logarithmic
 term 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(m_{c}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 The difference LO-SUB is the physical contribution to the total (TOT=LO+NLO-SUB
), and it is this combination which is smooth across the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

turn on
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the charm PDF.
 We now see that if we neglect the LO (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

) we loose the cancellation between LO and SUB in the 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\sim m_{c}$
\end_inset

 and our structure function (or cross section) would have an anomalous shift
 at the location where we arbitrarily turn on the charm PDF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So to recap, the combination of the LO and SUB terms ensure a minimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

-variation at low 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 scales, and the combination of SUB and NLO ensure the mass singularities
 are canceled at high 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 scales.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
FFNS: u-channel for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{F}=3$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us clarify the case where we work in a FFNS with 3 flavors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{u,d,s\}$
\end_inset

 but no charm PDF.
 In this case there is no LO (
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}$
\end_inset

) process as 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}=0$
\end_inset

, and there is no u-channel subtraction 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{g}\otimes{\cal P}_{g\to\bar{c}}\otimes\sigma_{\bar{c}W^{+}\to\bar{s}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is all perfectly consistent.
 However, the NLO u-channel process (
\begin_inset Formula $gW^{+}\to c\bar{s}$
\end_inset

) will have a potentially divergent 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(m_{c}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

 contribution from the exchanged charm quark; this is fine so long as we
 don't go to large 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 If we do want large 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, then we will need to resum the 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(m_{c}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

 logs using the charm PDF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We expect this FFNS to diverge from the VFNS result by contributions proportiona
l to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim\frac{\alpha_{S}}{2\pi}\:\ln(m_{c}^{2}/Q^{2})$
\end_inset

.
