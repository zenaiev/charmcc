Dear authors,
Thanks a lot for this nice draft and for all the work/results shown in it.
Below you can find some comments referring to just the main body of the paper (comments on the appendix will follow next week):

    L129: why the accessible range in x is up to 0.25 only? Have you generated the pseudodata by yourself? I’m asking because I used Max Klein’s pseudodata once and I remember they can reach x = 0.3
    
    >>> We use pseudodata provided by Max Klein, it is up to x = 0.25:
    http://hep.ph.liv.ac.uk/~mklein/heavyqdata/str100
    (it might depend on the final state and tagging method)
    
    L130: maybe it would be nice to quote the y coverage as well for these pseudodata (just because you talk about ‘y’ in the following)
    
    >>> DONE, sentence added: "The covered $y$ range is $0.0024 < y < 0.76$."

    L132 to L148: is this discussion about even and odd numbers of charm quarks really needed? These experimental considerations about the detections of charmed hadrons looks to me a bit out-of-place
    
    >>> ACHIM: Theory should try to predict what experiment can measure, and experiment
        should try to measure what theory can predict, so I think in a phenomenology paper, especially one focusing on future measurements, it is entirely appropriate and partially even necessary to discuss both and which consequences one has on the other.
        For the extraction of the strange content, it does matter whether one
        measures/predicts the electroweak contribution only, or the sum of the
        electroweak and "QCD" contributions, so I think this is worth discussing. If you have a suggestion how to change the wording or location of this discussion such that it appears less "out of place" that would of course be very welcome.    

    L244: When estimating the theoretical uncertainties, why did you check independent muR and muF variations just for FONLL-B? Can’t you do the same for FFNS A?
    
    >>> Unfortunately this is not available in the given implementation of OPENQCDRAD in xFitter (as mentioned in the text)
    
    L315 (Fig. 7): It might be nice to show one plot as a function of another kinematic variable, since you state ”Similar results are observed for the cross sections as functions of other kinematic variables"
    
    General comment on Fig 8-9-10: do we really need the black solid lines showing the total? Isn’t sufficient just to show the various fractions and quote the total x or Q2?
    
    >>> It is worth to keep the total line as reference
    
    Then a question (probably just for my ignorance): what does a fraction < 0 mean? See for instance the gluon contribution (green line) in Fig 8-b (NNPDF3.1)
    
    >>> FRED: You've touched on a very interesting aspect of the QCD theory.

        In the VFNS, when we include
        the charm PDF (which comes from g->c c-bar), there is a
        gluon-initiated subtraction term (g->c * Wc->s)
        which removes the double counting.

        In Fig 8-9-10 this gets "booked" under the gluon contribution which
        can drive it negative.  In a sense it is "correcting" for too large a
        charm contribution in certain kinematic regions.

        The balancing is most apparent in, for example, Fig.9a at lower x
        values and hi-Q where we see the gluon is going negative just where
        the charm contribution is rising quickly.

        This is also apparent in Fig.15 in the appendix.  Here we see the
        LO (cW->s) and the gluon-initated SUB (g->c * cW->s) match
        at low mu scales. At larger scales, the SUB exceeds the NLO (gW->cs)
        so that the total gluon initiated contribution [NLO-SUB] can become
        negative; however the TOT is relatively stable and well defined.
        The choice of the mu scale really does just "shuffle" contributions
        around among the separate sub-pieces, but the final result is stable. Neat!

        [Is it worth adding such comments in the text?]
        >>> Fred, can you add such comments please?    

FRED: YES, I'VE ADDED THESE COMMENTS  


    L394: a space needed between 100 and fb-1
    
    >>> DONE

All the best,
