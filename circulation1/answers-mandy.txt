I am certain that the equations for y\to 0 \nd y\to 1 are wrong.

It should be:

 

y\to 0, sigma+ =F2+ = xD +xUbar

             sigma- =F2-  =xDbar+XU

and this is NOT the way the brackets currently express itâ€”the second bracket is the wrong way round.

 

y\to1, sigma+=1/2(F2+-xF3+) =xUbar

            sigma-=1/2(F2-+xf3-)=xU

and this has been written the wrong way round
