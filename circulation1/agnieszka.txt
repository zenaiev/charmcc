1. It is not clear to me why the LO formulas are relevant
here. Are they expected to be reasonable at very large scales?
From Fig. 15 it looks as if there is large cancellation
between LO and SUB in F2.
Also the gluon gives large FL at NLO, 
differently from what naive QPM suggests.

>>> In fact, the formulas in Eq. (1)-(5) are not LO, but a quark-parton 
model approximation where one neglects the gluons. Of course, they are 
not expected to work in certain phase space regions and/or schemes, 
such as the fixed flavour number scheme where there are no charm quarks 
in the proton, or the variable flavour number scheme at low Q^2. 
Still, they are very illustrative and serve only as the starting point 
for the discussion.

2. A related question: is the difference at large y between different
schemes due to FL? 

>>> FL must be different indeed, although we do not look at FL in this paper,
instead looking at the reduced cross section which is the only directly 
measured observable.

3. What about the assumption s=sbar? I guess with the large uncertainty
on the strange PDF up to now such assumption is justified.
But do we have expectations how large s-sbar could be, and whether
it could affect precision measurements?

>>> This is a very interesting question, and initially we thought we 
can look at it by using pseudodata for e^-p and e^+p. However, according to Max Klein 
positrons are very difficult for the energy recovery linac, the initial 
source is down by at least a factor of 10 wrt e- and that means you would 
never run as long as with e- [which is the prime target to produce the Higgs 
in e-p CC], so only about 1/100 e+ lumi (and unpolarised) seems a reasonable assumption.
That is not so very bad, but definitely worse than e-, so we decided to 
concentrate on e- only (where one probes sbar).

4. I find the discussion of the diagram in Fig. 16/17 confusing.
At NLO there are the t- and u-channel diagrams, but they are
of course added coherently and interfere. I understand the argument 
is about logarithms whic are in the square of t and u channel respectively.

You also mention Q < m_c, but in this region shouldn't one
 also take into account the threshold, i.e. x<x_th.
I do not understand how the ``parton model diagrams'' 
can make sense there,

4. What do you mean by ``We consider the LHeC
facility as this is the single high-energy ep/A facility that
could potentially run in parallel with the LHC and provide
insights on these issues in advance of a FCC program.''

Is this comment related to similar x-Q^2 range as at LHC? Or literally
that two experiments run at the same time? Why is this not true for EIC?
