Thanks for the first daft,
I have some cooments.
1- in line 117 and 118, Two words (with and beam ) are repeated twice continuously. it may be changed: LHeC would collide an electron beam from newly built electron accelerator, with LHC hadron beam at the center of mass energy of ..
2-line 136 CC production of charm ..., can be confused the regular readers. I think it better to change to the " CC cham production"

Best Hamed
